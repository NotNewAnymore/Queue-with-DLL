This is mostly copied from the final, where we did not have to make the Queue using a linked list, for the sake of time.
The Queue is a first-in-first-out form of data organization. It is useful for when data or code needs to be processed in a specific order. If no user-defined methods, loops, gotos, etc. are being used, a C# or Ruby program is an example of a queue- it's both read and executed from top to bottom. As I'm used to using Ruby, I can get queue-like properties on an  array quite easily and still have it run well enough, so limiting myself to that data type does not make sense, but if a queue were made using a linked list, it would be extremely fast to get data from it.

Implementing a queue using an array is actually what I did, naievely thinking it would be faster to write. What I soon realized was that pretty much every feature I needed was also in the linked list class I'd made. Ultimately, an array-based queue is going to take less memory, and a linked-list queue is likely to run faster, assuming that the memory is not extremely slow.
